## Overview

This tool scans various stock universes (S&P 500, S&P 1500, Russell indices, etc.) to identify stocks that are breaking out to new highs with strong volume. It uses a momentum-based approach to find potential trading opportunities based on proximity to 52-week highs and volume surges.

## Key Features

- Multiple stock universe options (S&P 500, S&P 1500, Russell 1000/3000, TSX, custom lists)  
- Robust data downloading with retry mechanisms and batch processing  
- Breakout detection based on proximity to 52-week highs and volume confirmation  
- AI-enhanced analysis using Google's Gemini API  
- Detailed statistics and verification of data quality  
- Excel export of results  

## Core Algorithm

1. **Average Volume Analysis**  
   - Calculate 50-day average volume for each stock (\( \overline{V}_{50} \)).  
   - Identify stocks with abnormally high current volume relative to their average.

2. **Rolling High Calculation**  
   - Determine the 52-week (or custom lookback period) rolling high for each stock.  
   - Focus on the highest price in the window to identify potential breakout levels.

3. **Volume Ratio Calculation**  
   - Compare today's volume \(V_{\text{today}}\) to the 50-day average volume \( \overline{V}_{50} \).  
   - Higher ratios indicate stronger interest in the stock.

4. **Proximity Calculation**  
   - Measure how close each stock is to its 52-week high:  
     \[
       \text{Proximity} = \frac{\text{High}_{52\text{wk}} - \text{Price}_{\text{today}}}{\text{High}_{52\text{wk}}}
     \]
   - Smaller proximity values indicate the stock is closer to breaking out to new highs.

5. **Breakout Classification**  
   - **High Breakers**: Stocks within 5% of their 52-week high **and** showing volume surge > 1.2× average.  
   - **Soft Breakouts**: Stocks within 5% of their 52-week high but without volume confirmation.

## LLM Integration

The screener integrates Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model for enhanced analysis of screening results.

- **Model**: Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash  
- **Implementation**: Uses the `google-generativeai` Python package  
- **Authentication**: Requires a Gemini API key (stored in `.env` file)  

### LLM Functionality

The model performs several key functions:

- Validates screening parameters  
- Provides market context for the results  
- Analyzes patterns across breakout stocks  
- Offers suggestions for parameter refinements  
- Identifies potential anomalies in the data  

## LLM Prompt System

A structured system prompt guides the AI analysis through specific steps:

[VALIDATE]  Check parameters: universe_choice, soft_breakout_pct, proximity_threshold, volume_threshold, lookback_days.
[HYPOTHESIS] Explain your reasoning about what kind of stocks this screening should identify.
[CALCULATION] Explain key calculations (rolling high, proximity, volume ratio) in plain language.
[ANALYZE]  Interpret the results—what do the found breakouts indicate for trading?
[VERIFY]   Sanity-check outputs and highlight any anomalies.
[SUGGEST]  Recommend additional screening parameters that might improve results.

## LLM Output Structure

The output from the LLM is a JSON structure that contains the following fields:

- **Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the screening results
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improving the screening process
- **Anomalies**: Identified anomalies in the data

## Installation

To install the Momentum Stock Screener, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/momentum-stock-screener.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd momentum-stock-screener
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Set up the environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following line:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     ```

## Configuration

The configuration for the Momentum Stock Screener is stored in the `config.py` file. You can customize the following parameters:

- **Stock Universe**: The list of stocks to be screened.
- **Lookback Period**: The time period used to calculate the 52-week high.
- **Proximity Threshold**: The percentage difference from the 52-week high to consider a stock as breaking out.
- **Volume Threshold**: The volume ratio to consider a stock as breaking out.

## Usage

To use the Momentum Stock Screener, run the following command:

```
python momentum_screener_llm.py
```

## Custom Stock Lists

You can specify custom stock lists in the `config.py` file. The format should be a list of stock symbols.

## Performance Notes

The Momentum Stock Screener is designed to be efficient and scalable. It can handle large datasets and provides detailed statistics and verification of data quality.
